          The 3E seminar series are organized as part of the Doctoral Training Unit (DTU) 3E - Experiments, Ethics and Economics - which consists of an 
          interdisciplinary consortium of social scientists who use experiments involving human subjects in their research. The objective of the consortium 
          is to create a formal link for collaboration across the three existing social science research laboratories in Luxembourg, with a view towards 
          improving our understanding of what we know about human behaviour in economic and social interactions. 
          <br><br>
          The seminar is also sponsored by the Competence Centre in Experimental and Participatory Research (EXPAR). The aim of EXPAR is to improve awareness 
          of and skills in experimental and participatory research methods to strengthen LISER's position at the forefront of internationally high quality, 
          scientifically rigorous and societally relevant research.
          <br><br>
          The 3E seminar series is organized once a month and invites leading researchers to discuss their work on behavioral and experimental research. 
          You can download the program in PDF <b><a href="files/2024_Program.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#3ac7c7;">here</a></b>.
          <br><br>
           We also organize and internal seminar series for PhD students to present new research ideas and discuss work in progress.

            <h4>An Affect-Based Computational Framework For Modeling Risky Choice with Non-monetary Outcomes</h4>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p> The development of formal models of decision making under risk has been shaped largely by decisions between options with monetary outcomes, 
              with the most prominent model being cumulative prospect theory (CPT). Whereas CPT is good at describing choices between monetary lotteries, 
              it shows poorer performance in the context of decisions between options with nonmonetary and nonnumerical outcomes (e.g., medications with 
              possible side effects). We suggest that this may be due to affective processes and context-dependent evaluation---which are not considered in 
              CPT---playing a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices. We propose three psychologically motivated modifications to CPT's modeling 
              framework to capture these differences: (a) representing the subjective value of a nonmonetary outcome by an affect rating (rather than a monetary 
              equivalent); (b) determining the subjective affective value of an outcome relative to the value of the worst outcome in the choice problem; 
              (c) assuming that the probability weighting for an outcome depends on the amount of affect triggered. We submit model variants of CPT implementing 
              the proposed modifications to a model comparison in three empirical data sets. For choices between options with negative nonmonetary outcomes 
              (medications with possible side effects), these modifications substantially improve CPT's performance relative to that of the original version 
              of CPT. The same does not hold for monetary choices. Overall, in addition to fleshing out key differences in the processing of monetary and 
              nonmonetary risky options, our work demonstrates how affective processes can be formally integrated within classical theories of decision 
              making under risk.</p>

            <p>Fragile states struggle to develop basic and essential capacities like tracking and paying employees. Developing these capabilities presumes confidence that the state will continue to exist, which is not  assured in fragile states. We present the results of a randomized evaluation in Afghanistan, where the government implemented a major reform to modernize its teacher payroll system. This required teachers to biometrically register and receive digital salaries. This reform made employees legible to the state, reduced payment delays, and increased financial inclusion for teachers. We also find suggestive evidence that the reform increased student learning. Notably, implementation was most successful in districts with higher public confidence in the government’s ability to prevail against the Taliban. This result points to a complementarity between confidence in future stability and the development of basic state capacity.</p>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>In the impunity game, responders, unlike the ultimatum game, cannot affect proposers' outcomes. Proposers in this game, like in the dictator game, have full control over their own outcome, as rejection from the responder has no effect on their payoff. Thus, the theoretical prediction of this game states that the responder should accept any offer. An experiment is designed aiming at analyzing both players’ behavior in the impunity game when subjects are aware of the gender of their partner. Additionally, we examine the effect of different stake sizes. In a first stage, an online experiment with eight different treatments is implemented, with a total number of 1,210 observations. From this data, the main findings are that proposers give to responders an important (around 35%) share on average, and that the stake, size as well as the gender identification, affect subjects' decisions. Moreover, responders’ rejection patterns follow the game theoretical prediction, although the hypothesis that knowing your counterpart sex/gender affects responders’ behavior cannot be rejected. Several sociodemographic characteristics are found to affect subjects’ behavior in this game, like personality and psychopathy traits, as well as their emotional intelligence level. New data for a second stage of this experiment where doodly vignettes tacitly transmit gender features and overcome other limitations of the previous stage, reinforce some of the results mentioned above.</p>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>We present experimental evidence that enabling access to universal early child care for families with lower socioeconomic status (SES) increases maternal labor supply. Our intervention provides families with customized help for child care applications, resulting in a large increase in enrollment among lower-SES families. The treatment increases lower-SES mothers’ full-time employment rates by 9 percentage points (+160%), household income by 10%, and mothers’ earnings by 22%. The effect on full-time employment is largely driven by increased care hours provided by child care centers and fathers. Overall, the treatment substantially improves intra-household gender equality in terms of child care duties and earnings.</p>

            <p> Job seekers face uncertainty about their abilities, and whether these match with job requirements. Such uncertainty may result in sub-optimal job search outcomes and job matches. We conduct a field experiment among job seekers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Participants underwent a skill assessment and were asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for information about their relative performance on a test of general intelligence. WTP is positive for about 80 percent of the population, and is associated with gender and personality. Feedback provision leads individuals to update their beliefs which only persists for individuals with low WTP. We provide evidence that suggests imperfect recall as potential mechanism for the lack of persistence. Feedback increases job search intensity but relatively lower for initially overconfident individuals and those with negative or zero WTP, which results in lower realized wages for these groups. The heterogeneity in belief updating, recall and job search behavior is consistent with some overconfident job seekers being unable to forget information and, thus, to maintain motivated beliefs, but being sophisticated about this inability to forget.</p>
